        A: The genetic structure of the virus [SARS-CoV-2] was sequenced within weeks of its discovery, and it was done with the help of both scientists and engineers.Optical, electrical, mechanical, computer, and chemical engineers were all involved in making that possible.
        Another area where engineers are playing a role is in the scale-up of therapeutics and vaccines, Scientists are discovering the vaccines that is a scientific task, though there is also engineering in it but when you go from making 100 doses to a billion doses, that is a huge engineering challenge, The same is true for manufacturing therapeutics, Engineers are working on that right now
        Engineers are also working on maintaining the integrity of the supply chain , getting equipment such as masks to where they are needed, and getting the right chemicals together to make vaccines and therapeutics, and those come from all over the world
        We have also applied artificial intelligence and machine learning to facilitate the rapid development of therapeutics and vaccines. Artificial intelligence processes a lot of information to identify promising routes to therapeutic interventions. For example, what drugs could be used to prevent the antigens on the outside of the virus  which allow the virus into your cells from getting into cells?
        And engineering has allowed telework. If this had happened 20 years ago, where would we be? We would not be communicating with each other like this. Broadband, wireless communication, 5G, Zoom, and other platforms  all of these technologies have been elevated by this pandemic.
        As a final example, engineers are modeling the transport of aerosol droplets as it relates to transmission of the coronavirus between two individuals and among groups, so that effective countermeasures such as enhanced ventilation can be taken.
