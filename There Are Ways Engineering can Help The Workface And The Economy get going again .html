	<h1>Are there ways engineering can help the workforce and the economy get going again?</h1>
    A: Every time there is a crisis or a major problem, there are opportunities that lead to improvements  For example, there will be more people with ideas about how to distribute things   leading to more Amazon like companies  There will be innovations in rapid diagnostics; the Holy Grail is a home test for COVID-19 There will be new platforms   I do not think Zoom is the end; there will be competitors  These will all produce jobs   We are also learning more about education, so you will see more companies emerging around home schooling and education      
Much of the economy will come back in information technology and manufacturing  and then in the service industry, because you will need to service all of these things  I actually think COVID will lead to more economic development once we control it
