<h1>Do engineers approach problems like the pandemic differently from scientists?</h1>
<p>
A: Engineers would be nowhere without science, and science would be nowhere without engineering  because engineers put into motion what science has discovered. National Medal of Science winner Theodore von Karman said, {Scientists discover the world that exists; engineers create the world that never was} They are both important
{Engineer} is a verb, which means that it is action oriented It is a key way we look at life  Engineers consider themselves problem solvers and also creators  We create products, processes, and systems that address economic and societal needs  like the ability to telework. Engineers are used to thinking in systems; a pandemic is a system, for example, and society is a system.
